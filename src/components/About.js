      <p>
        Since I got into programming 10 years ago I worked for many different projects for fun and
        professionally. While studying computer science and electronics I earned my living as a
        freelance software developer, web designer and online marketing consultant. In 2017 I
        founded a startup trying to build a platform for community-driven projects. During this time
        I developed a native android app, a hybrid app and several features for the web backend. I'm
        currently focusing on Progressive Web Apps built with React JS.

        To free my mind from promises and linter warnings I like to cook with/for friends, listen to
        a podcast while having a cup of coffee or running at the Dreisam.
